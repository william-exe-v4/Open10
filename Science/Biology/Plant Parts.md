# Plant Parts
- Chloroplasts: conducts photosynthesis
- Chlorophyll: green dye in chloroplasts
- Waxy cuticle: waxy epidermal layer at the top of leaf for protection
- Pailsade mesophyll: top layer of leaf that contains chloroplasts
- Spongy mesophyll: bottom layer of leaf for gas exchange
- Guard cells: stoma(ta) control
- Stoma(ta): cells for gas exchange (CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>)
- Lenticels: cells for gas exchange in the stem
- Roots: absorbs water and nutrients from the soil
- Xylem: transports water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves
- Phloem: transports water and some sugar throughout the plant

## Xylem vs Phloem
| Xylem | Phloem |
| - | - |
| made of dead cells <sub><sub>reported</sub></sub> | made of living cells |
| transports water and nutrients | transports water and less sugar |
| from roots to leaves | throughout the plant |
