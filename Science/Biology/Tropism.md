# Tropism
Tropism is the response of a plant to external stimulus. There are 4 main types: 
- Gravitropism: response to gravity (for ex. growing against gravity for more sunlight)
- Phototropism: response to light (for ex. moving to face the sun)
- Nastic response: response to touch

These can come in the form of positive or negative. Positive being responding towards that stimulus and negative being avoiding the stimulus. (for ex. growing upwards is negative)
